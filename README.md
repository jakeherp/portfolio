This is the repository for my personal portfolio site [herper.io](https://herper.io/) built with [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), TypeScript, Styled-Components and Contentful.
This project is a constant work in progress, so if you find any bugs, typos or other errors, please feel free to open an _issue_ or a _pull request_. This project is open source, so please feel free to fork and adapt for your own projects (credit would be appreciated).

## Getting this project up and running

1.  **Fork or Clone**

    Fork or clone this project from Github to get your own copy of it.

1.  **Add Contentful Credentials in environment files**

    This project is based on Contentful, add your own credentials in `.env.development` and `.env.production` files or remove Contentful dependency to use another data source instead.

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd portfolio/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `portfolio` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.tsx`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## 🎓 Learning Gatsby

- **For most developers, we recommend starting with the [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to their documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar.
